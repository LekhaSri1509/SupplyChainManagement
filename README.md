# SupplyChainManagement



AIM: 

The aim of this project is to analyze and optimize supply chain operations using various techniques such as 
finding the top supplier, calculating shortest distances, identifying minimum and maximum values for 
attributes, sending email alerts for low product availability, and visualizing supply chain data through 
interactive charts and graphs. 
CONCEPT: 

 Divide and Conquer: 
Divide and Conquer involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, 
solving them independently, and then combining the solutions. It's exemplified by algorithms like 
merge sort and quicksort. 

 Greedy Approach: 
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of 
finding a global optimum. They're efficient but don't always guarantee the best solution. Examples 
include the Knapsack problem and Dijkstra's algorithm. 

 Dijkstra's Algorithm: 
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source to all other 
vertices in a weighted graph. It iteratively selects the vertex with the shortest distance from the source 
and updates the distances of its neighbors. It's commonly used in routing and network optimization.
